On December 29, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a Joint Analysis
Report confirming FireEye’s long held public assessment that the Russian
Government sponsors APT28. Since at least 2007, APT28 has engaged

in extensive operations in support of Russian strategic interests.

The group, almost certainly compromised of a sophisticated and prolific
set of developers and operators, has historically collected intelligence on
defense and geopolitical issues. APT28 espionage activity has primarily
targeted entities in the U.S., Europe, and the countries of the former
Soviet Union, including governments and militaries, defense attaches,
media entities, and dissidents and figures opposed to the current Russian
Government.

Over the past two years, Russia appears to have increasingly leveraged
APT28 to conduct information operations commensurate with broader
strategic military doctrine. After compromising a victim organization,
APT28 will steal internal data that is then leaked to further political
narratives aligned with Russian interests. To date these have included

the conflict in Syria, NATO-Ukraine relations, the European Union refugee
and migrant crisis, the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics Russian athlete
doping scandal, public accusations regarding Russian state-sponsored
hacking, and the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

This report details our observations of APT28’s
targeting, and our investigation into a related
breach. We also provide an update on shifts in the y,
group's tool development and use, and summarize :
the tactics APT28 employs to compromise its victims.
